<b>*Problem Setting*</b>

A company would like to set up pop-up shop or food truck on the Burke Gilman Trail North in Seattle, WA if a predictive model can forecast anomalous high crowd from current facts about the crowd size.

<b>*Data/Challenges*</b>
* The target is binary but highly unbalanced
* The dataset has the pedestrians and bikers crowd size in the South path, and North path, as well as date and time.
* The main challenge was deciding where to split the dataset for training and testing
